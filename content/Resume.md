<h4>Intern</h4>
During the internship I analyzed many processes in order to seek and map the main causes which generate non quality costs. After that, with the support of the quality management, I identified the concerning KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) to control the entire process in order to realize a KPIs dashboard. I also developed a tool in VB.NET to control and to collect non quality cost and to examine some of the KPIs pinpointed in the first phase. The non quality costs are tracked by a coding tailored system. Lastly the tool has been integrated in SAP.
