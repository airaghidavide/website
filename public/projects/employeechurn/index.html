<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<p>Employee churn is a costly problem for companies. The true cost of replacing an employee can often be quite large.
A study by the Center for American Progress found that companies typically pay about one-fifth of an employee’s salary to replace that employee, and the cost can significantly increase if executives or highest-paid employees are to be replaced.
In other words, the cost of replacing employees for most employers remains significant. 
Defining Turnover CostsThere are three main components associated with the cost of turnover</p>
<ul>
<li>Staffing: in addition to the cost of recruiting and hiring the person initially, the organization must now spend a similar amount to hire the replacement.</li>
<li>Vacancy: the period of time where that person isn’t working in the company results in lost productivity and potentially lost business.</li>
<li>Training: employees aren’t 100 percent productive from the moment they start.  So, it’s necessary to invest time and resources for training, on-boarding/orientation, and development</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve employee retention as well as possibly planning new hiring in advance</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the employee churn of a firm. Starting from a synthetic dataset we want to classify which employee is most likely to leave the firm.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The machine learning model experiment is developed on a sythetic dataset and the results are explained with the SHAP values technique in order to showcase to the customer the features with the biggest impact on the model prediction.</p>
<h3 id="methods-used">Methods Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Exploratory data analysis</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Predictive Modeling</li>
<li>XAI with SHAP</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>
